These are the instructions to install the KWRocketryRedux.

There is a new document included with this mod, called one of the following
depending on which file you downloaded:

	KW Redux Install for Dummies
	KW Redux Install for Dummies Manual Install

in both MS Word and PDF format.  It is much easier to follow than the 
following instructions.


IMPORTANT:  You MUST install one of the two power response directories,
otherwise the engines will not work.


How to install:
Firstly, Insure any older version of KW has been removed. (GameData/KWRocketry)


----MAIN INSTALLATION----
Now, for a normal install simply unpack the GameData folder included in the download 
>> MERGING << the folders when prompted. 

----POWER RESPONSE ----
There are two different power response configs.  One is an instant response,
similar to stock, and the second is a graduated power response, where it takes
the engines a few seconds spool up to full thrust

----GRADUATED POWER RESPONSE ----
For the graduated power response on engines 
you have to extract the GameData folder contained within the Extras/GraduatedPowerResponseConfigs 
folder after having previously installed KW Rocketry as above.You should merge and overwrite 
the parts files when prompted and this should mean your engines have instant power response. 

----INSTANT POWER RESPONSE ----
For alteratively instant power response on engines 
you have to extract the GameData folder contained within the Extras/InstantPowerResponseConfigs 
folder after having previously installed KW Rocketry as above.You should merge and overwrite 
the parts files when prompted and this should mean your engines have instant power response. 

The following are optional:

----REDUCED CLAMP SOUNDS (RECOMMENDED)----
A replacement sound file for the stock launch clamp as by default it drowns out our
custom sound effects.
Reduced Clamp sound installation is similar to that above, extract the GameData 
folder from within Extras/ReduceClampSounds.


----SUB ASSEMBLIES----
To install the subassemblies, simply extract the folder labeled Subassemblies located 
within the Extras folder into your KSP save folder of choice, for example:

Kerbal Space Program/saves/(SaveGameName)/
